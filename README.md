# 🏭 Agent Factory — Digital FTEs

Building production-ready Digital Full-Time Employees (FTEs) following the [Agent Factory](https://agentfactory.panaversity.org) methodology by Panaversity.

This repository contains my implementations of AI agents designed to operate as autonomous digital workers — reliable, testable, and deployable AI systems that can handle real business tasks 24/7.
