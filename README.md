## 🎯 Mission

Transform domain expertise into autonomous AI agents (Digital FTEs) that generate recurring revenue.

**The Vision:**
```
Domain Expertise → SKILL.md → Digital FTE → $500-2K/month Revenue
```

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings (Chapter 1)

### Two Paths Framework
- **General Agents** (Claude Code, Gemini CLI) = The Builder
- **Custom Agents** (OpenAI SDK, Claude SDK) = The Product
- **Insight:** General Agents BUILD Custom Agents

### The Role Shift
- Developer as **Typist** → Developer as **Orchestrator**
- Human 10% (strategic) + AI 90% (mechanical)
- Value = Intelligence directed effectively

### Digital FTE Economics
| Metric | Human FTE | Digital FTE |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Availability | 40 hrs/week | 168 hrs/week |
| Monthly Cost | $4-8K | $500-2K |
| Scaling | Linear | Exponential |

### Four Revenue Models
1. **Subscription** ($500-2K/mo) - Managed Digital FTE
2. **Success Fee** - Pay per result
3. **License** - Sell SKILL.md to enterprises
4. **Marketplace** - OpenAI Apps, volume-based
